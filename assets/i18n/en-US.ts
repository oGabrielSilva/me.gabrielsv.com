    'Hi! My name is <strong>Gabriel</strong>, and I enjoy <strong>creating things on the web</strong>. My interest in development started back in <strong>2016</strong>, when I discovered <strong>RPG Maker</strong>. Playing around with game development taught me a lot about <strong>programming</strong>. It didn’t take long for me to stumble upon <strong>Gustavo Guanabara’s</strong> channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CursoemVídeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Curso em Vídeo</strong></a>) and discover <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I even bought a book about it. But there was no turning back—creating and adapting so many pieces of code brought me <strong>to where I am today</strong>, and I’ve <strong>never regretted it</strong>.',
    'Today, I hold a degree in <strong>Information Technology Management</strong> from the <strong>Federal Institute of Sertão Pernambucano</strong>, but I primarily work in the field of <strong>development</strong>.',
